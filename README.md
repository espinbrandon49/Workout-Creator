## Description 
This is an application to find exercies to create a fitness workout routine.  I used the [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/details) API to return the exercises.  

Basically one can search for a body part or muscle group such as "pectorals" or "chest" and receive a number of exercises with a gif showing how to do the exercise correctly.  

Hover over the gif to see an instructional and click the gif to see it at full scale with additional details and add to your exercise routine, which is saved in local storage, if you like it!

Hopefully you enjoy this application and can use it to research or create an exercise routine.
